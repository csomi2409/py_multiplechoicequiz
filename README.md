# Multiple Choice Quiz in Python | Created by Bence Csomor

Contains 2 programs (quiz.py, question_class.py)

The ``quiz.py`` program has a list where the questions are stored. The questions are called one-by-one by a self-made module.

Used 1 module [question_class] 

The program runs continuously. It only stops, after the user answered all the questions given in the list.

I implemented a score system.

Source code contains comments.
